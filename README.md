### :smiley_cat: Introduction
Hi, my name's Eric.
I graduated from Rutgers in 2014 with an English degree, got a job
as a low-voltage electrical technician, realized my favorite part of the job was working
with computers, and now I'm back in school learning IT support. It's been a trip.

### :grey_question:	 About Me
* :student: I'm working towards a certificate in Computer Support, and I plan on taking the CompTIA A+ and Network+ exams within the next year. 
* ðŸ‘· Right now, I work on fire alarms, security systems and home automation for a low voltage contractor. 
* :european_castle: I do medieval reenactment. We build catapults and stuff. 
* :desktop_computer: I build and repair computers as a hobby. I built this evil microwave two weeks ago because I needed a tower that would fit under the shelf on my desk.
